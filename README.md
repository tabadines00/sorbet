# Sorbet
A React.js-like tool for my personal websites, built from the ground up. This is a project to dissect and learn how to create a library like React, but without the NodeJS backend in order to serve all files statically.

## Current Features
- Div Class: Implemented a Div class for "writing" HTML in vanilla JS
  - Can nest Div instances just like in HTML
  - Can change HTML properties and children in JS
  - Call .render() to render the instance to HTML

## Planned Features
- Rerendering of specific elements for reactivity
